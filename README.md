# emscripten-wasm-project-template

This repo is used to contain the base template we use to build our game client and / or other apps that need to function
with WebAssembly and emscripten. The idea is to offer a project template that "just works" and allows to quickly start new
projects or design iterations and is focused on rapid development.
